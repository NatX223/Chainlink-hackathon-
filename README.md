# Chainlink-hackathon-
Project for chainlink hackathon 
The project is focused on providing an avenue for people to send and receive money in form of any tokens available to them.
This is very useful as there are a lot of tokens out there and there  needs to be  some universality about payments, where virtually any token that has value can be used a medium of exchange and that's what this project aims to tackle.
